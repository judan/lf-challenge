Revision date: 2 April 2025

The goal:

-   Our team is excited to see your programming style, skill, approach, and creativity applied to a single-page web app.

-   One way we're able to assess engineering candidates on a level playing field is by giving every serious contender for a position on our team the exact same assignment with the exact same inputs to see how they approach their thinking and execution.  This helps us reduce bias in our selection and make the interview process fair for everyone.

The challenge:

-   Using any publicly available API of your choosing (examples include Yelp, Flickr, New York Times, etc.) build a simple, single-page web app with at least two screens. One screen should show a list of items from that API while the second screen should show a detailed view for those items. Use this as an opportunity to be creative and demonstrate your familiarity with frontend web technologies.

-   Use React as the view layer.  Feel free to use additional tools or frameworks as you see fit, but avoid relying on fully-styled UI kits like MaterialUI or Blueprint.  

-   Tests are required. They may take any form deemed appropriate for the app (such as Jest or Mocha tests) but should demonstrate a basic understanding of testing a single-page web app.

-   Minimally, make sure the app functions smoothly on Chrome, Firefox and at least one mobile browser.

-   Use of 3rd party libraries for common tasks (networking, etc.) is acceptable.

-   Use of open source code included directly in the project should be limited and clearly attributed with a link to the original source.

-   Code produced by generative AI is prohibited.

-   The app must be placed in a public repo on a site like GitHub or Bitbucket.

-   The app must be able to be pulled down from this repo and built without any additional configuration. For example, Livefront should not be responsible for getting its own API keys or access. If an API key and/or username/password is required you can send that to us separately (it does not need to be stored in the repository)

Due date: Friday, April 4 (ideally)

-   We typically give candidates ~1 calendar week to complete the challenge, but in this case we are aiming to provide feedback quickly and ramp up on client work. 

Hint: 

We're a senior group of folks who see software as a craft. We'll be looking for well-structured code that follows best practices, is well-tested, doesn't have errors, is commented appropriately (e.g. comment on your public interfaces), considers edge cases, and demonstrates your creativity and love of software.
